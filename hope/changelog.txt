24/10 Matt: Merging chase cam and player control code from A & C
- Overwritten mesh.h & mesh.cpp with mesh contents from c branch
- Added chase_cam.h & .cpp
- Tidied gameScene.h/cpp (moved input to a separate function, more explicit var names)
- Added ball; add force code works find, but chase cam has an issue - not sure what to change.
