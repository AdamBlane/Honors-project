\section{Introduction}
From the beginning of the project the intention of the project has been to develop a mathematical equation to evaluate escort mission maps and to procedurally generate maps that can successfully follow the evaluation technique created. The dissertation produced underneath documents the processes and work that were involved in achieving this honours project.
\subsection{Motivation}
With video games being one of the largest markets in the world right now, gaming companies must be developing and releasing their games as quickly as possible and \vspace{5mm}any shortcuts that can be taken should be. 
\newline  
One of the biggest genres of games currently is team based shooters. This genre of game has a very different development cycle to other games relying on continual updates adding new maps and characters to keep players interested and continually playing. To release new maps and characters on a regular basis can be difficult especially if the game has a large competitive scene because the new feature \vspace{5mm} must be fully tested before released.
\newline  
With testing new features in games becoming the most time consuming part of the development cycle, companies must look into other ways to streamline the testing of games. In this project one of the possible ways to decrease the time taken to test maps is explored. If companies can use a mathematical formula to test the fairness of maps, rather than the more conventional user based testing which can take up to several weeks, would allow for companies to produce more content in a quicker time frame, generating a greater profit and allowing for better content to be produced in the future. 


\subsection{Aims and Objectives}
There are two main aims of the project, the first is to create, implement and evaluate an algorithm that assesses escort mission maps once this has been complete, the next is to plan, develop and produce a piece of software that can successfully follow the algorithm produced. The objectives below have been selected in order to accomplish these aims.
